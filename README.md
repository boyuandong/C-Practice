                - **test()** can call fun by calling base pointer.
                - **test2()** can create a list that combines different types of elements.
                - **test3()**   can create a linked list by adding ***Employee *next;*** in [Employee class](https://github.com/boyuandong/C-Practice/blob/main/C%2B%2B/class/inherit/virtual/Employee_Wage_Management/Employee.h).
